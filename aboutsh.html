<div class="wrapper"><h1>About</h1><p>Though I've already given a brief introduction of myself on the home page, I'll go a little more in depth here.</p>
  <p>My name is Sadie, and this is me (and my best friend/business partner/other half of my noise band and eventual recording studio/production company called "ZUZAX", Angelo.) That's very hopeful. But he taught me to manifest, so, that's what I'm doing. This picture is from the tour we took with Big Gulp and Plunge, two ABQ bands, around New Mexico and Colorado this November. It's a place called Bar Bar. It's exactly what you think it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm a film major, but, I've got lots of different interests that I like to think are large chunks of my personality--I paint, I write, I photograph, I film and I do a whole lot of weird in-between stuff. I'm incredibly passionate about music and film history, and I'll talk the ear off of anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>It has taken me this long, but I think that, above all else, I want to become a career screenwriter. It's a passion I've only discovered this year (which, of course, is what they all say--I'll probably exhaust myself and change my mind within a year, but for now screenwriting is the end goal!) I have spent nearly every free moment I have writing since I was a kid, and all of that practice has gotten me one full, complete screenplay (and tons of drafts, scraps, stories, junk and whatnot). I have been working on another screenplay, as well as a novel, for quite some time now.</p>
<p> Below is the mockup poster I created in order to submit my screenplay to a screenwriting contest:</p>

<p> I think the most important thing an aspiring writer can do is get good at--or, at least <em>try--</em>many different kinds of writing. This is why I've tried screenwriting, novel writing, journalism (I have taken a position as a freelance culture reporter for the Daily Lobo, and, it is definitely the hardest one), and endless variations of academic writing.</p>
<h2>Why all this?</h2>
<p>If I'm going to spend every moment of my life creating something, I want to be able to put it somewhere that it can get archived, rather than get lost to time. I struggle with technology but there is no success without struggle, so, I am struggling through learning coding so that I can have my own control over a personal archive. This is something that will take a lot of time and a lot of mistakes, and that I can accept. So, with that being said, I have made a first attempt at archiving a few select pieces on this here world wide website.</p>
