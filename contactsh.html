<div class="wrapper"><h1>Contact</h1><p>Here you will find my contact information, for my school, work, and personal endeavors. I am reachable through both emails, and through my Instagram account. </p>
<p>Though my major at UNM is Film History and Criticism, I have many different interests, including art, photography, writing, and music.</p>
<h1>Personal Contact Information</h1>
<p>On Instagram, I post artwork and fliers for local music venues, as well as speed paints of my artwork, and other creative projects. In addition to artwork, I also write for the Daily Lobo under the Culture Editors, which I have included links to below.</p>

<h2>Music Blog</h2>
<p>My music blog is also linked below, where I discuss different aspects of musical life around Albuquerque. I work with musicians to put together photo collections, vlogs, and other records of their live sets. I also work with a local venue called Renâ€™s Den, mixing sound and performing odd jobs just to help out and extend my gratitude to the venue. </p>
