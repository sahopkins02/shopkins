<div class="wrapper"><h1>Education & Resume</h1>
<p>Below are the specifics of my education and job history. I've been through a whole lot of expectable nonsense in the customer service world, and every time I reflect on it in some way, I get a little more excited about a future where I will <em>never have to service customers again.</em></p>

<h1>Film Degree</h1>
<h2>Major: Film History and Criticism</h2>
<p>I've taken almost every single 300 Level film class that I possibly could have over the past four years. I've seen everything, from early WWII propaganda animations that no one has ever seen beyond the drafted soldiers they were made for, to bizarre horror deep-cuts, to Marvel schlock. I've seen it all and yet somehow, I've still barely scraped the surface of film. But, that, I think, is the beauty of film school.</p>
<h1>Daily Lobo Contributions</h1>
<p>I have been writing culture reports for the Daily Lobo since about September 2023. These are all of the articles that made it to publishing--this excludes the ones that were cut and the ones that were unfinished. This is another reason I decided to start learning this very difficult trade; I've gotten into journalism, and though I'm not quite Raoul Duke, The Doctor of Journalism, I certainly think it's good practice.</p>

<h1>Awards & Recognitions</h1>
<p>These are the credits I've got, at least the notable ones. Things like a now-defunct 5 star Etsy shop aren't exactly winning over any hearts.</p>
